# Time Series Forecasting Model for the Stock Market

Time series data prediction is an essential area of research in finance, and 
economics, among others. It involves analyzing and modeling data collected over 
time to make future predictions or forecast future trends. With the increasing 
availability of historical data and advancements in machine learning and deep 
learning techniques, time series data prediction has become an increasingly 
popular research topic in recent years. In this work, we investigate the application 
of machine and deep learning models to time-series data for predicting the optimal 
time for trading stocks and options. Time-series data is defined as a collection of 
historical data points ordered by time, commonly used in predicting stock prices, 
stock indexes, and cryptocurrency prices. We use a publicly available 
dataset of Japanese stocks and options to train and test Support Vector Regression 
(SVR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The goal is 
to improve trading strategies by identifying the best times to buy and sell assets 
based on predictive models. The performance of the model are compared using 
three accuracy measurements: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared 
Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The study has shown that The 
LSTM with dropout technique provided the best possible results with MSE 
0.000124763, RMSE 0.011169727, and MAE 0.009058733.
